D’ailleurs, ChatGPT dit : 

Il est essentiel de faire une coupure à la fin de la saison, notamment pendant l’été, pour permettre au corps de se reposer et de se régénérer. Après des mois d'efforts physiques intenses, de compétitions ou d'entraînements réguliers, le corps accumule fatigue, microtraumatismes et stress. Sans période de récupération adéquate, ces petites blessures peuvent s'aggraver et conduire à des problèmes plus sérieux comme des tendinites, des fractures de stress ou des blessures chroniques.

Le repos permet aux muscles, articulations et tendons de récupérer en profondeur. Cela permet aussi de rééquilibrer les niveaux d'énergie et de préserver la motivation mentale. Une pause estivale aide à réduire le risque de surentraînement, qui peut entraîner une baisse des performances et un épuisement physique et mental.

En outre, la coupure permet de recharger les batteries, de retrouver de la fraîcheur et de repartir avec une meilleure condition pour la prochaine saison. C'est donc un moment indispensable pour optimiser la santé physique, mais aussi pour favoriser un meilleur équilibre entre performance et bien-être sur le long terme.",2024-09-25 16:44:27+00:00,4285,Run,"Nantes, France",5.22,8.62,45m 0s

Christian is an absolute dog with how well rounded and versed he is in this sport. All of our SLCC team is knows how to work gruesomely. I truly come from an amazing team and am coached by the best man on the planet. Also can we talk about Aiden Troutner’s sub 4 minute mile? 3:59? At elevation? On the BYU indoor track? Shout out to Coach Wood and Eyestone for helping me get rid of my side cramp just seconds before the race on the start line before the gun went off. Shout out to Todd Garner for walking all the way out in the snow storm and back from his car to supply me with water because he wanted me to be as hydrated as possible for our race. Shout out to Riverton, Herriman, and American Fork XC|TF and parents for coming to watch and support me. And to all of you who came up to me today. Shout out to God. My sister and friends for coming.

The goal of this workout was to teach me to pace myself and hit these splits without depending on a watch or another runner so that I can be prepared for anything. We all made coach really proud and it was fun to see his face right afterwards, the sprinters and mid’ d group went off as well.

This race was tough. All I can remember in it was, “dang, what’s happening?” But I’m grateful. I got into a great race, a great heat and a great opportunity. Recap: Gun went off. I tried to get out with the two pacers. The heat was aggressive. Got boxed in and struggled to get out. Eventually got out and then decided to stay in 4th, relax, then sit and kick. The competition started to get heavier so I looked at coach for counsel. After about 2 more laps, I got in 2nd, then so many guys started exchanging leads so I decided to chill. Then I got passed by a few more guys and then afterwards coach told me the pace of the race was too slow so I decided to put my foot on the gas. When the pacers were done at 3k, I made a huge surge and took the lead. I held it for about 6 laps just hoping I’d have enough to conserve in the tank, and then I felt the heaviness set in. I kept the pace going and did a lot of the work. I ran tuff. The black out vision started to set in and I wanted to quit so bad, I still had 7 laps remaining. I dug deep and kept going. I got passed. Then made another surge, then got passed again, and again and again. Then I gave it my all in the final 800m, finished 6th and still secured the NJCAA record officially finally and PR’d by a mm of a second. I’m glad I finished the race when it got hard because we did what we came here to do. I knew my team was counting on me and I knew it wasn’t just about me. I prayed. Both coaches are proud. Family and friends are. And so am I. Thanks to everyone for tuning in on Flotrack. I did my absolute best to prepare for this race and I laid it all out there. I know I have a ton of work to do if I want to go pro by next year but I’m not giving up yet. And I’m grateful to have coaches that are gearing me in that direction. It was super fun also having Adam  Wood, his sweet sweet wife, and Rory Linkletter cheering me on. Time to enjoy Boston for the next 6 hours if I don’t crash on this couch from exhaustion after posting this. Anyways, God is great. #NYTJ #SLCCBelongs.

Then started going too fast again and then I tried to listen to coach but then I panicked because I wasn’t confident in pacing myself properly. (I’m new at this pacing stuff.)Then I started going too slow. Eventually got into the rhythm by the Grace of God and savaged a perfect split in the 1200m.

Gonna keep Trusting in Him and have Faith that I’ll be right for Bryan Clay this weekend. The boot that the trainers have given me, has been helping me a lot.

2327,48348730,JaQuavious Harris,11451933898,5k National Champ but crying because I will miss SLCC this Summer🥲 also this is prob my fav post race recap below ⬇️:),"A weekend I won’t forget. 92 degrees and 98 percent humidity. Our team did great and I was able to pull it together for my team by the grace of God and win the 5k National Title with a lot of help and aid; I’ll get into that. First of all, shout out to Lindsie for being women’s 10k National champ and all of the All Americans that were born this weekend. Recap: the conditions were mind wrenching. It was blazing hot. This entire week here was, but man that 5k at 4:10 in the afternoon was something else. We were constantly having to apply ice cloths on our necks at all times up until the starting line, drench our heads, faces and shoulders with water, my body was constantly going in and out of it and it was a little harder trying to keep my body temperature regulated than I thought it would because it was tough. I remember Hunter, Jayden and I going into prayer after our warmup for God to sustain us minutes before the race. While we were on deck under the check in tent getting ready to go, we were all going back and forth constantly to get more water and ice rags as much as the race directors allowed us to before we were required to go out on the track for lineups and strides; however, we finally stepped out out on the track and everything changed. The gun went off and I felt a switch. Don’t get me wrong, the heat still was there, but it’s like I felt the host of Heaven out there grant us all God’s grace. Hunter and Jayden had this immense energy and they felt good, and I had this peace and I just knew this race was  going to be fun. The race started out and went out all over the place: fast, slow, moderate, tons of alternating leads, some aggression but also some bonding, all the opposite things going on at the same time;  I found myself on the inside of the rails, in the middle boxed in, off the rails, getting splashed with water cups, handing water cups to my teammates, (we were doing anything and everything we could to stay awake and be ON.) we had tons of fun and I even had some conversations with some of the guys from Trinidad, Pima, Iowa and New Mexico during the race and at this point it wasn’t only about winning, but to enjoy the process, celebrate each other for making it this far to the finals at Nationals in this HOT air and just let the race run itself and let whoever the winner be, be the winner. It became an honor and the stadium gained an enriching respect for us because they knew how tough this was being in this weather. The Spirit told me to turn my brain off, but to still be present enough to hear and listen to all of my coaches just in case race plans were to change, when to stay calm, and when to make moves. Around 9 laps in, I knew the race was mine. With 2k to go, I made my move,  but at this point the heat came back and I could feel the steam from my shoulders and my hair, and my heart grew humble as I knew I could still loose if I gave up, and I knew that I wasn’t a National Champion until I crossed that finish line. I looked around for my teammates Hunter and Jayden, and just trusted in God and decided to take it for them and the rest of my team. The temperature got higher but by the grace of God the pace got lower and I kicked faster. My team started going federal cheering NYTJ,NTYJ,  and let’s go JQ(x20) & my coach and friend Aiden raised my dad’s hat once again and I knew it was time to go, even if I was burning up, I knew that the Spirit of fire wasn’t unfamiliar and that gave me the courage to go.  I raised my heart to the Heavens and closed the last mile in 4:19 and saluted all glory to God at the finish. We did it, team. God is real and I once again say thank you. Proud to say, Nationals is now officially under wraps but my season still isn’t over. Your boy JQ is still in the game. The Olympic Trials is right around the corner and it’s time for me to get in GEAR as I’m racing the my special event that has my heart, the 1500m at Portland Track Festival. Excited for what’s to come and ready to work horrendously and pay my dues.  I’m grateful for Coach Wood for bringing me on this team, Coach Aiden for being one of my best friends ever, Coach Tom, Kelsey and Coach Tom for their endless support since we’ve been training in June. Also for Coach Tom’s wife and all the parents who came out and our athletic trainers who came out and made sure we were healthy, happy and equipped to compete this weekend. Shoutout to our friend, brother, teammate and camera man Nate for getting these amazing shots and photos of us as well.

This workout was cold and windy. 4 mile warmup, then coach wanted 6miles at 5flat, no rest in between just straight running) after saying a prayer on where I should do the workout the Spirit told me, “let’s go do this on the track.” (I normally do these types of workouts on the road, when I do them alone.) but with the Spirit guiding me, I felt in my heart I wanted to do this on the track for 2 reasons. (I knew I wouldn’t be stopping and I didn’t want traffic to interrupt me, and for reason 2, with racing the 1500 on the track in just a few weeks, I wanted to be more used to doing speed on the track as much as possible so that it wouldn’t feel any more foreign to me during the race than it should feel. with the cold and wind on the track, it started getting mental after about 2 miles in during the workout portion. I said a prayer to my Heavenly Father and Angels to get a prayer up and give me an extra set of legs. I wanted to stop but the Spirit told me to trust in God and in my coaches that if I did everything consistently in this workout like my coaches told me to do, then I’d be set to run at least a 3:37 at PTF in a few weeks if not faster. I stuck to it and remembered that I wasn’t just running for myself. But for God, family, friends, coaches, my team at SLCC, and for all of you. That helped carry me through, and to also remember why I wanted it. For this reason, this was my favourite workout I’ve ever done in my life. And I’m so much more mentally confident going forward in my running career after staying tuff in this workout. 6 mile cooldown afterwards.

Race went out hot, coach had me play it conservatively and sit at the back of the pack. Hobbs went out, and then the lead pack consisted of Jared Ward, Michael Ottessen, Me, Joey Nokes and Jake Heslington. The first few miles to me were all about having fun, staying relaxed and keeping these gaps closed as much as possible because these guys are all pro and elite so I knew I didn’t want to loose a chance at closing with any of them. About 1.2 to go, I knew I needed to start rolling because at this point I knew that finish line was going to be long as it always is at Des News, and Joey is super fast and Jake Heslington could close. I could feel him coming and my legs were starting to get tight. I feel like I was probably a little too conservative because I feel like I could have went a little faster and maintained and probably placed better, but I’m glad I listen to coach. As the last mile was a grind and I knew that I didn’t want to get out kicked, and get 4th, I prayed and secured 3rd. I’m very happy with how fast I can recover and get in shape. What a great workout this was as well. This is a good mental reminder for me that I’m feeling like I’m sitting in a good place for this upcoming and final cross season; however, I’m excited to work because I know Nationals will probably be a cat and mouse grind.

2415,48348730,JaQuavious Harris,12403954132,BYU Autumn Classic Invitational,"Man. What. A. Race.!We all got out hard, the pack was aggressive, but fair. I’m really impressed, there were like 14 guys in the leading pack still halfway through the race. Then Casey Clinger put his foot on the gas, and then we went for it. After .5 miles later, it boiled down to Casey, Creed Thompson and me. This race felt pretty easy still for me(the high mileage is really helping me) but then I felt so good that I took the lead and made a surge .84 to go; unfortunately I wasn’t specific enough to know when to go and just went off of feel. I thought I had it, normally when I take a surge if I feel I’m going to win a specific race, I go for it. But I think I underestimated that Casey literally finished 5th in the Olympic Trials finals, and Creed also ran in the trials in the 10k, so these guys aren’t as easy to close on as other competitors that I’m used to running with. I kept the lead until 400m to go and they both passed me. I still closed pretty close to them and proud of what I did.  Even when I got passed, I still fought and didn’t let it get to me like I normally do if I get passed in races. I truly gave it everything in the tank the last 400 meters. Something I’ve learned in this race is that it’s a lot easier to succeed when you are running relaxed, calm, let the Holy Spirit guide you and when you feel like you belong in that group.  I’m excited to get to run with these guys again in Oregon in just a few weeks and see try it again with a much more conservative mindset. This was honestly super fun though. Also our SLCC team packed together like no body’s business and it was federal. I’ve learned a lot from today and it was probably the best race I’ve ever ran thus far in my career.   As the first race of the season, I’m feeling pretty great but I’m even more excited to work. Shoutout to Casey and Creed on 1st and second. :) #NYTJ",2024-09-13 15:44:51+00:00,1193,Run,"Vineyard, USA",4.19,4.75,19m 53s

It was me, Casey Clinger, James Corrigan, Creed and Davin Thompson, Joey Nokes, Aiden Troutner, Lucas Bons and a guy from UCLA in the leading pack. At the first mile, there were a lot in the pack and it was super boxy. I was trying hard not to fall out of the tangents out of fear of getting DQ’d, but I tucked in and maintained. I felt great and around mile 4 I felt the lactic. I stayed and fought. First and foremost I’m grateful we got into Dellinger. The fact I got top 8 in this kind of race shows I’m working. Yet, I still have a lot of work to do. Our team did amazing. The conditions were perfect. I feel like I should have been further up at the end but I’m happy with a 23 flat. Less than a second from breaking 23. But hey, I’m still in the learning stages of this sport and I’m grateful we got to represent today. NYTJ. I’m not giving up and I’m still working. :) I am honestly really happy with this because it shows that progress is being made, but I’m going to keep pushing and do some amazing things. I have a lot more in the tank, and I’m eager to keep striving. It was truly an amazing feeling being in that pack in the final stages of this race and got to show that JUCO runners can run. And I’m proud of our team for beating a lot of D1 schools. It shows our coaches truly know what they are doing. Congrats on BYU today on their perfect score. 🤍",2024-10-11 18:15:37+00:00,1390,Run,"Lane County, USA",5.1,4.53,23m 10s
