Got right on the pacer and drove the rest until 700m to go. Closed last 800 in 2:02. Was paced a bit slower than wanted so the time doesn’t really matter but definitely competed better. Still need to close faster, the video shows where I made a move at 300m to go and didn’t fully commit which could’ve gotten me the dub. BU can Ligma for moving my seed time back twice and bumping me out of heat two but we’ll take the progress.

BROOOOOOOOOO

So I’m in the building mileage faze innit, and I saw this race was handing out some prize money and good vibes so I figured it would be competetive for where I’m at, so I said fuggit let’s spice up the training.

Weymouth is 2hrs from me dawg, YOU KNOW I’m cooking coming in from Western MA since no one is on the roads since it’s Sunday and I got my first speeding ticket ever.

NEXT. I register on the deadline at 9:15, race starts at 9:30, BUT, bro, I gotta hop on the shitter. So then I’m in line until 9:28. THE START LINE IS FORMING.

BUT BROOOOO I still had my sweats and trainers on so then I had to go in the opposite direction to put flats on and allat. 

BANG. Race goes off and I’m 400m BEHIND THE START. Bro, that means I gotta catch up and weave between many a person.

Ended up 6th for a good effort but ran fast enough for second 😭",2024-08-25 13:28:16+00:00,1106,Run,"Weymouth, USA",3.35,5.5,18m 26s

1607,33993248,Conner Mantz,12109498018,"“Jive, survive, thrive”","Coach’s race plan: “Jive(15k), survive(17.2k), thrive(10k).” Don’t go any faster than 4:46 in the first 15k, then run the hills chill, then hammer the last 10k. 

Short recap: I’m happy with the race. I tried to put myself in medal contention as long as I could, and believed I could medal. A gap up front formed around 28k and I decided to be patient and hope to catch back up, but never got back in contention for a medal. 
Long recap:
I ran close to coach’s race plan. The first 15k had a lot of shoving and close calls. I missed my bottle at 10k due to being shoved from behind, but Clayton shared his again. We hit the hills around 15k, and the race began to feel a lot easier with not having to move around a lot. I should’ve ran more conservative the first 15k instead of trying to catch every move/be on the inside of the turn. I saw Tola take the lead between 15 and 20k and went with him. I tried to conserve on the last part of the uphill right after 20k, but then it felt easy to catch back up. At halfway there were 2 or 3 of us, and I was pretty excited because the pace felt very easy and I wouldn’t have to take the lead from Tola. However, Tola kept looking back at the pack and slowing down, which led to me clipping him a couple times. 
Around 25k the pack was back to 13 or so, with Clayton being at the back of it. It was helpful to see him there. A Japanese runner then started pounding the pace, and we split a (net downhill) 14:30s 5k. 
At 28k the last 5k was in my legs and I felt pretty beat up, so I took the hill conservative, and just looking at the ground and trying to stay consistent, hoping that the hill would break the guys up front and I could still chase a medal. I think I was the last guy dropped from the top pack at that time. After, during the steep downhill my legs buckled and I nearly fell due to me running very reckless down the hill. I slowed to be cautious, but was heartbroken as I was hoping that would be my way to catch the front pack and try to medal. The last 10k I saw two athletes I focused on slowly catching. One in a blue kit, the other was Abdi from the Netherlands I think. After catching the athlete in the blue, I caught Abdi about 5k later. We were running the same pace until he decided to drop out and he began to run 5:45-6:30(I couldn’t really guess, but I caught him very quickly when he began to slow down). 
After that I could just see Tebello in the distance. When I could see him I would speed up, but when I couldn’t, it was tough to keep pushing, as he had about 100meters on me, I’d miss him around the curves. With 1200m to go, I saw I needed to run just under 3:30 to break 2:08. I tried for a bit, but when I saw no one close behind me and Tebello so far away, I decided to keep pace and enjoy the moment. I was surprised how well I closed today, as that is something I’ve struggled with during all but my first marathon. I did take the most fuel during this marathon than I had before, and we started relatively slow, so those may be the contributing factors. While I may not have followed coach’s plan 100%, I learned a lot and was grateful to compete in the Olympic Games. Thanks everyone who cheered me on, the crowds were amazing.",2024-08-10 06:01:06+00:00,7692,Run,"Paris, France",26.58,4.82,2h 8m

Felt too fast from the gun, but ran up front to compete. After 2 miles, I felt settled in. The hills and wind dictated the pace. Mile 4 felt really smooth(likely due to the strong tailwind), but the split showed it was too fast. Somewhere around here I noticed it was two of us up front. When I glanced to the side I couldn’t tell it was Yemane (noticed it was him at mile 9). I looked back at about 5 miles and saw Clayton not far behind.  

Tried to drop Yemane a few times but the distance between us didn’t change. I saw the 10k split was about 28:15. I was pretty excited about most of our splits, but the uphill 6th mile was a little discouraging. I made time goals as the race went on as it was hard to drop Yemane, and time goals were motivating. 

Mile 8 and 9 were pretty quick, and I hoped I could break away. Yemane passed me on the other side of the street around mile 9, and I responded. We hit a strong headwind and steep downhill for the last 800m and we battled it out. At about 600m to go I began to pull away and just tried to press to the line.",2024-10-06 11:55:02+00:00,2713,Run,"Minneapolis, USA",10.07,4.48,45m 13s
