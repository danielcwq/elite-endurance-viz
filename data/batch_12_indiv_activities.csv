14,30804228,Ryan Ford,10597755389,USATF XC Champs - 10th place,Ran in the pack and felt good until a surge just before 8k separated me. Felt relaxed and in control in first 4k but so did all the contenders as well. Wasted too much energy changing position multiple times and spending time in 2nd place during the 2k-4k lap. You dummy. Ended up spending a little too much time feeling sorry for myself from 8 to 8.6k when a surge from Morgan caused me to lose contact just before 8k. Tried to make a big move out of the chase pack and Drew Hunter came with and was rallying too. I wasn’t picking my legs up as effortlessly anymore and clipped one of the log barrier we had to hurdle over with less than a k to run and almost took a tumble and lost a lot of momentum and contact with the back of Drew. I just couldn’t get myself going again just when I started to feel I was rallying. I raced a bit dumb and definitely cost myself wasted energy in a few spots. I think we rerun the race and I make the team but I am sure others are thinking that too. It sucks but I learned and I am more fit than last year for sure. Time to get some track results to show for it. Mind is already racing with things I can do better next training block. We. Move. 🦍.,2024-01-20 23:15:52+00:00,1779,Run,,6.2,4.78,29m 39s
