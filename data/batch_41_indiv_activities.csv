If you‚Äôre someone who loves the Moab area, I‚Äôd encourage you to read up and follow along with the situation ( is a great place to start). 

Essentially a development project is underway that is attempting to construct luxury housing IN THE FLOOD PLAIN of Kane Creek. This area is known for its gorgeous scenery, recreation opportunities, and is even the site of the Moab Trail Marathon and Half Marathon (an event the perhaps some of you have been lucky enough to experience). It is also a very delicate ecosystem and early stages of this development have already done irreparable damage to the area. The decision to construct a development like this in a flood plane makes it painfully obvious that there is no consideration for the long term (for the creek ecosystem OR the houses), only a quick buck to be made by developers who will wash their hands of the mess before the inevitable fallout. Unfortunately I see this as yet another example of many where Utah has decided it‚Äôs otherworldly treasures are worth nothing more than a shortsighted opportunity for quick profit. If this is an area you care about as a runner, cyclist, climber, or even an ATV enthusiast I‚Äôd encourage you to spread the word and help protect the places you love to experience and recreate in.  has great info on the situation, petitions to sign, places to donate, and people to write!

A number of things come to mind, but I believe near the top of the list is a lack of regular hill workouts. I used to run hills at least once every two weeks through college and through my first couple years after college. I eventually had to quit doing hill workouts during my build for the 2020 Olympic trials as my achilles took a major down turn. By the time I eventually had surgery I was in a new training group and hills reps weren‚Äôt a major component in our training plans. As I tinker with daydreams about getting back to training a higher level of training, I‚Äôm making it a priority to get my hills in early.

First 5k in 20:05
Second in 20:06
Transitions took about 70 seconds each

Feeling very proud of this effort. I honestly had absolutely no idea how fast my legs could handle after the bike and honestly just fresh. Started out hot on the first one and cooled it down mentally to stay fresh for the bike. The last thing I wanted to do was burn myself out and run a 23 min second 5k. Finished the first lap strong in 4th/5th place (i don‚Äôt remember). Moved into the transition pretty fast but forgot to put on my helmet before putting my bike shoes and that slowed me down a couple of seconds. 

Got into the transition area and moved really fast to get my bike shoes off and runners on. Got a cramp in my left calf while getting my shoe off but it went away almost instantly. Attacked hard the first half mile up a little hill and onto the gravel. Was pushing a fair bit but felt that I had more left in the tank. Continued moving up past some people on the run and pasted somebody in my particular race headed back to the finish line. That 2nd mile I fell into a comfortable rhythm and forgot about the race a little bit. I had a checkpoint in my head on where I would need to push extra hard and when I got to the downhill portion I tried to move as fast as I could. Legs were heavy but turnover felt the best since pre injury. Started to move faster down the finish line shoot and finished pretty strong as I normally do. 
Some other random things to note: Why would there be a complete U-turn on a 8 foot wide path?! Basically had to stop on both laps to flip; pretty annoying when I was gaining momentum. Past the finish line there was no space for me to slow down at all basically had to jump stop to not crash into everything. 

Overall I am feeling blessed that after all my lower back issues since December I am able to bounce back and race again, even after doctors told me I may never again. Very thankful; even if this running performance is nowhere near what I have left in me.",2024-07-20 13:28:28+00:00,5627,Run,"Boulder, USA",6.49,14.43,1h 33m

On another note, this run was great, had to cut off a smidge of distance so I hiked down this really steep hill only to discover a creek at the bottom that I had to jump across. Then I saw a nice beaver in Rocky Creek and we watched eachother for a bit and I just find it amazing that she could sit there in the middle of a half frozen creek mostly submerged in water and only 3 degrees out.

Rob claimed he thought there was EIGHT cars for every driving age American. Ben said 5. I think Owen said 2.2 which seemed somewhat reasonable. I said 1.3 and there were some others that chimed in but can‚Äôt remember. Rule was that we count every car that‚Äôs able to start, and we only count people 16 or over. We also tried to come up with countries that would have more cars per capita but that was kinda harder. I said Monaco or Lichtenstein or Vatican City. Ben said Romania. 

Online it says that only 91% of households have a car, and the average household has 1.79 cars. Also, Wikipedia says the US is the 8th most with 908 cars per 1000 people. Lichtenstein is #4 and Monaco is #7. Romania is #60 sorry Ben :(
Gibraltar is #1 in case you‚Äôre wondering.

And you run by a prairie. Then a cornfield. Then you run by a cornfield. And then you run between a prairie and a cornfield. Then you turn again and run by a soybean field. And then eventually you go all the way around the field and have the option to stay on the grass or go on a squiggly limestone path (choose the grass it‚Äôs better) and then you pop out behind this barn which seems weird but then you make it back to the parking lot.
