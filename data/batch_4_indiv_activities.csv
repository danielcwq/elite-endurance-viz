They ended up being WR pace… and I had absolutely no competition or people cheering really.

1495,23718316,Jake Ritter,12477465404,MLK Dream Run “15k”,The goal of winning a free Alaskan round trip flight anywhere they fly was obtained! Originally the plan was to just go with the leader(s) and then go with like a mile to go. The first 4 miles we went out in like 5:10 pace and the leader started to drop off so I just kept up the pace and slowly made a gap. The whole race was supposed to be a “sidewalk race” and there was at least one turn that wasn’t really marked at all so I’m glad I brought my phone with me with the course map. I ended up almost never on the sidewalk since it would’ve been harder and more dangerous. I definitely went a little harder than prescribed and my body actually felt it a bit afterwards but still the effort wasn’t anywhere near race pace. I don’t recover very well after using the endorphin speeds (3s) so I don’t think I’ll wear them for anything besides long runs when needed.,2024-09-22 15:13:06+00:00,2810,Run,"Portland, USA",9.13,5.13,46m 50s
