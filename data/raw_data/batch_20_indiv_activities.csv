Very much a yo-yo of a 600m. Got stuck behind guys that went out hard and then slammed on the brakes after 200m and proceeded to die, so had to work around them when there was space. Threw in a hard surge with 250m left, so honestly would‚Äôve been a 28sec middle 200 I hadn‚Äôt. Just surged a little too hard too quickly and hit my wall with 75-100m left and just fought to hang on.

Shoutout Luciano Fiore for the dub and qualifier for Milroseüî•üî• Man killed that raceüòÆ‚Äçüí® As for me, not a great opener for the year, but valuable lessons learned moving forward. Waterfall start with 11 guys crushed me, especially after they moved me from the outside alley to the inside alley 30secs before the start. Didn‚Äôt really know how to get off the line and use momentum from the turn to my advantage with the waterfall star, so got bumped, ran in lane 3 a bit of the curve before conceding position to the back of the pack and then it was a hole I couldn‚Äôt get out of from there. Just don‚Äôt have the gears rn to hammer a move midway through the race to move up, so tried to time a move with 250m left, got tripped up with a few others, and then just kind of lost focus mentally the last 100m being so far from ‚Äúin the race‚Äù.
