Battled for 4th place today in what was by far the toughest race I've ever done! It took A LOT of mental strength to finish, with my legs hitting a brick wall around 18km... but it helped that I was catching and passing some of the other elite women who had started to suffer, too!

Delhi was hit with a huge spike in humidity and pollution levels in the days leading into the race. The air was SO thick. Never experienced anything quite like it! ü§£ Breathing was already hard through the first 5km which made it a long slog to the finish line. ü´Å 

I decided very early on I was going to run on my own and at my own pace, letting the main pack go ahead. Trying to pick off as many people as I could over the 2nd half. I was actually pretty gutted to find out I was only 10s off the podium in the end! üòÖ

Still, what an experience! How many people can say they've got to race around the closed streets of New Delhi?! The course is super flat with thousands of local runners taking part. I was surprised by how many people were shouting my name and supporting me around the course. Thank you! ü´∂

Gisteren mocht ik deze twee toppers begeleiden tijdens een trainingswedstrijd in Heerlen. Karsten Jetten(links) is in voorbereiding voor zijn debuut op de marathon in Amsterdam, waar ik hem al ruim 5 maanden online voor coach. Jonah Rohi (rechts) traint voor de marathon van Eindhoven, en ook hem coach ik al een aantal maanden.

Beiden zitten midden in hun voorbereiding. Gisteren was een generale repetitie tijdens de Obvionrun (halve marathon). Karsten liep 13 km op marathonintensiteit en versnelde daarna de laatste 9 km richting zijn halve marathon tempo. Jonah liep 3 blokken van 5 km op marathontempo, en gaf in de laatste 3 km nog wat extra gas.
