673,26028112,Fearghal Curtin,10595974976,Big South XI,"Continuing with the daily theme of hypothetical starting 11‘s on strava, here is the Big South XI. Formation is an Italian style 5-3-2, overlapping wing backd and a false 9, that‘s the level of thought I have put in. 
Director of football: Michael Kelly. Proven eye for talent. No brainer.
Head coach: Jim Stintzi. Record of delivering results on a shoestring budget. Hates VAR.
Assistant coach: Brant Tolsma. A Joe Jordan disciplinarian, willing and able to dish out a bollocking when needed. A serial winner.
Volunteer assistant coach/player: Amon Terer.
U21 coach: Adam Huff.
Club Ambassador/advisory role: Sam Chelanga. Camera‘s frequently pan to him during games as commentator quips that he “could still do a job“.

GK: Trayvon Harris. Excellent height and reflexes but has no command of his area and can produce some absolute howlers.
RWB: Kelvin Kirui. Quick and reads the game well but final delivery often lets him down.
CB: Rob Howorth. Injury prone, ball playing CB, early career John Stones type of player.
CB: Alejandro Juan Torres. Steady pair of hands in the middle of the back 3. Dominant in the air but lack of lateral quickness. Shades of Younnes Kaboul.
CB: Tom Joyce. Experienced CB that can go on a Marauding run forward when chasing the game and also can snuff out a counter attack.  
LWB: El Hocine Bouchrak. Versatile full back. Good in the air and scores plenty via late runs to the back post.
CM: Meschack Kipruto
CM: Amon Kemboi. Double pivot of dreams with Kipruto, think of Moussa Dembele and Victor Wanyama. 
ST: Azaria Kirwa. False 9 foil striker for Kioko. Runs the channel and links up play with the full back. A relentless gegenpresser. A modern day Mario Mandzukic combined with the languid style of Dimitar Berbatov.
ST: Athanas Kioko. Prolific 30 goal a season striker. Rarely plays a full 90 minutes however. 

Subs
Joshua Bowers (GK) Produced far too many howlers to be considered number 1 keeper. Big question marks regarding focus levels. 
Sira Pina Cardono (RWB) Pace merchant who’s kept out of the team due to a lack of physicality, a discount Jordi Alba. 
Gavin Kuhlenbeck (LWB) Good option off the bench when defending a narrow lead as jumping ability lends itself well to defending balls into the box, plus loves a tackle.  
Griffin Gillespie (CB). A wildcard pick but with a name like that, he is no doubt a solid CB, albeit a lack of ball playing ability makes him vulnerable to a press.
Fearghal Curtin (CM). Box to box midfielder with questionable decision making and even more questionable character. A poor man‘s Blaise Matuidi.
Colin Schultz (ST) Reliable goal scorer. Comes into his own when squad is decimated by AFCON. 
Jaymee Domoney (ST/CM). Pashun merchant midfielder who loves a tackle and produces the odd thunder bastard. Fills in as a false 9 when squad is decimated by AFCON. Joins the dots between Mark Noble and Kevin Davies.
Lawrence Kipkoech (ST). Would start in most sides. Chips in with massives goals off the bench, the Big South‘s answer to Divock Origi. 
Dennis Kiptoo (ST). Sub par goals to game ratio but a real pesk to defenders in the gegenpress. Cult hero.",2024-01-20 15:42:59+00:00,4529,Run,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",10.42,6.83,1h 11m
